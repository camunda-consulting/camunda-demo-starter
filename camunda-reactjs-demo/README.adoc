# Camunda React

This project contains a simple UI written in ReactJs that can be used to demonstrate how to start a Camunda Process Instance and how to view User Tasks.

### Quick Start

See the https://github.com/camunda-consulting/camunda-demo-starter[`camunda-demo-starter`] project to quickly start a fully functional Camunda 7 or 8 demo environment that includes this project.

### Development

This project is a Spring Boot Java Application that runs a ReactJs web application. This makes it possible to take advantage of Spring Security and other Spring goodies.

Clone this project (the `camunda-demo-starter` project) to your local machine

 git clone https://github.com/camunda-consulting/camunda-demo-starter

The `camunda-reactjs-demo` directory contains the relevant files for this project.

Once you have the code, use maven to compile both the ReactJs App and Spring Boot

 cd camunda-reactjs-demo
 mvn clean install

The Maven build will perform the following:

* Use Webpack to build/transpile the JSX files into a bundle.js javascript file
* Copy `bundle.js` into `src/main/resources/static/built`
* Build the Spring Boot Application that uses Thymeleaf to serve the ReactJS UI

#### More Details about the Spring Boot Project

* Thymeleaf is a spring project for UI templating. It looks in the `src/main/resources/templates` directory for a `.html` file to serve.
* A Spring Controller is configured to serve the HTML on a specific context path. See the controller `src/main/java/com/camunda/poc/starter/controller/ui/UiApplicationController.java`

Set the following environment variables:

 export SERVER_PORT=3000

Use the following command to run the spring boot project:

 mvn clean spring-boot:run -Dspring-boot.run.profiles=cors,prod

### Configure the camunda-data-api endpoint

This project relies on the `camunda-data-api` project to provide a backend api where the React app gets data.

In the .env file in the project home directory change the environment variables to match the spring-boot server context for the data-api.

NOTE: If running the react app as a standalone and not on localhost configure the API_HOST and API_POST environment vars as follows inserting your host and port for the spring-boot server. You should only need to do this if you cannot access the spring-boot server on localhost and you plan to run the React App standalone.

    API_HOST=http://127.0.0.1
    API_PORT=9000
    API_ROOT=api

IMPORTANT: You will need to use the cors profile in this setup and potentially modify the cors config in the spring-boot app.

By default, the data-api reset api should be available here:

 http://localhost:9000/api

### Docker Compose

When demoing or distributing it makes sense to build this project with docker-compose. When you follow the "Quick Start" steps in the camunda-demo-starter project, the docker image is already built and deployed as a GitHub Package. But, if you are customizing this project, you can also run the docker-compose command like so:

```
 docker-compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml up -d --build reactjs-demo
```

### Developing with NodeJs

Even though everything can be built using `mvn`, it's often convenient to use `npm` and `webpack` to run the ReactJs webapp so that it's possible to update react javascript files and then refresh the browser to see the changes in real time.

NOTE: The following steps have been tested against node v13.14 on mac osx. Use https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm[`nvm`] to quickly install node version 13.14

* Run the following to ensure your npm dependencies are up-to-date

 cd camunda-react
 npm install

* Start a node server process

 npm run live

* Start another terminal and start a `webpack` process

 npm run watch

* Confirm the `node` and `webpack` processes are up and running.

** Browse to http://localhost:3000/app.html and ensure that the form is displayed.
** Make a change to `/src/main/js/reactjs/app.jsx`. Wait for webpack to build the new `bundle.js`, then refresh the browser and make sure you see your changes.

#### More Details about Javascript Environment

* The Javascript/JSX files of interest are in the `src/main/js` folder.
* The files in `src/main/js/reactjs/application/components` are reusable components.
* The files in `src/main/js/reactjs/application/usecase` are use case specific components
* The file `src/main/js/reactjs/application/app.jsx` is the entry point to the application.
