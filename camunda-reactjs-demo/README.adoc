# Camunda React

This project contains a simple UI written in ReactJs that can be used to demonstrate how to start a Camunda Process Instance and how to view User Tasks.

### Quick Start

See the https://github.com/camunda-consulting/camunda-demo-starter[`camunda-demo-starter`] project to quickly start a fully functional Camunda 7 or 8 demo environment that includes this project.

### How to contribute

To contribute please fork the project and then make your changes in a branch and create a pull request. The maintainer will merge your changes into the project. Please be sure to remove any customer information from the code or artifacts. See the next sections for more details on setting up your development environment.

### Development

This project is a Spring Boot Java Application that runs a ReactJs web application. This makes it possible to take advantage of Spring Security and other Spring goodies.

Clone this project (the `camunda-demo-starter` project) to your local machine

 git clone https://github.com/camunda-consulting/camunda-demo-starter

The `camunda-reactjs-demo` directory contains the relevant files for this project.

Once you have the code, use maven to compile both the ReactJs App and Spring Boot

 cd camunda-reactjs-demo
 mvn clean install

The Maven build will perform the following:

* Use Webpack to build/transpile the JSX files into a bundle.js javascript file
* Copy `bundle.js` into `src/main/resources/static/built`
* Build the Spring Boot Application that uses Thymeleaf to serve the ReactJS UI

#### More Details about the Spring Boot Project

* Thymeleaf is a spring project for UI templating. It looks in the `src/main/resources/templates` directory for a `.html` file to serve.
* A Spring Controller is configured to serve the HTML on a specific context path. See the controller `src/main/java/com/camunda/poc/starter/controller/ui/UiApplicationController.java`

### Configure the camunda-data-api endpoint

This project relies on the `camunda-data-api` project to provide a backend api where the React app gets data.

TODO: add url to camunda-data-api github project.

In the .env file in the project home directory change the environment variables to match the spring-boot server context for the data-api.

NOTE: If running the react app as a standaalone and not on localhost configure the API_HOST and API_POST environment vars as follows inserting your host and port for the spring-boot server. You should only need to do this if you cannot access the spring-boot server on localhost and you plan to run the React App standalone.

    API_HOST=http://127.0.0.1
    API_PORT=9000
    API_ROOT=api

IMPORTANT: You will need to use the cors profile in this setup and potentially modify the cors config in the spring-boot app.

### Docker Compose

When demoing or distributing it makes sense to build this project with docker-compose. When you follow the "Quick Start" steps in the camunda-demo-starter project, the docker image is already built and deployed as a GitHub Package. But, if you are customizing this project, you can also run the docker-compose command like so:

```
 docker-compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml up -d --build reactjs-demo
```

### Developing with NodeJs

Even though everything can be built using `mvn`, it's often convenient to use `npm` and `webpack` to run the ReactJs webapp so that it's possible to update react javascript files and then refresh the browser to see the changes in real time.

NOTE: The following steps have been tested against node v13.14 on mac osx. Use https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm[`nvm`] to quickly install node version 13.14

* Run the following to ensure your npm dependencies are up-to-date

 cd camunda-react
 npm install

* Start a node server process

 npm run live

* Start another terminal and start a `webpack` process

 npm run watch

* Confirm the `node` and `webpack` processes are up and running.

** Browse to http://localhost:3000/app.html and ensure that the form is displayed.
** Make a change to `/src/main/js/reactjs/app.jsx`. Wait for webpack to build the new `bundle.js`, then refresh the browser and make sure you see your changes.

#### More Details about Javascript Environment

* The Javascript/JSX files of interest are in the `src/main/js` folder.
* The files in `src/main/js/reactjs/application/components` are reusable components.
* The files in `src/main/js/reactjs/application/usecase` are use case specific components
* The file `src/main/js/reactjs/application/app.jsx` is the entry point to the application.
