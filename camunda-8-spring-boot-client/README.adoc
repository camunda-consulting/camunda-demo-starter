# Camunda 8 Spring Boot Client

This project contains a https://docs.camunda.io/docs/apis-clients/java-client/[Camunda 8 Zeebe Java client] using Spring Boot. The client the following examples:

* Email Worker that communicates with smtp service
* A "User Data" Worker that makes use of the data api service to query user data.
* A "Mock Worker" that will show logs
* A rest api to start workflows
* A rest api example that shows how to correlate messages

### Quick Start

See the https://github.com/camunda-consulting/camunda-demo-starter[`camunda-demo-starter`] project to quickly start a fully functional Camunda 7 or 8 demo environment that includes this project.

### Development

Clone this project (the `camunda-demo-starter` project) to your local machine

git clone https://github.com/camunda-consulting/camunda-demo-starter

The `camunda-8-spring-boot-client` directory contains the relevant files for this project.

Once you have the code, use maven to clean and build.

```
cd camunda-8-spring-boot-client
mvn clean install
```

There are several environment variables that must be set to control the behavior of this project. Remember to set the following:

```
export MAIL_HOST=localhost
export MAIL_PORT=2500
export DATA_API_URI=http://localhost:9000/api
```

Then start the spring boot app like so:

 mvn clean spring-boot:run -Dspring-boot.run.profiles=local,email,user-data

### Adding custom Process Diagrams

This project includes a `send-email.bpmn` process diagram that demonstrates the User Data Worker and Email Worker.

To deploy the diagram, open the `send-email.bpmn` in Camunda Modeler and deploy to the the zeebe engine which should be listening on port `26500`.

Of course, it's also possible to create your own custom process diagram and deploy the same way.

### Docker Compose

When demoing or distributing it makes sense to build this project with docker-compose. When you follow the "Quick Start" steps in the camunda-demo-starter project, the docker image is already built and deployed as a GitHub Package. But, if you are customizing this project, you can also run the docker-compose command like so:

```
 docker-compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml up -d --build camunda-c8-client
```
