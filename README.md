# Camunda Demo Starter

The purpose of this project is to have a starter for PoC and other less structured engagements. This enables the consultant to easily discuss and demonstrate common concepts and patterns without customizing the application. Additionally it can be used as a starter project in many cases.

## Quick Start

Follow the steps below to use Docker Compose to quickly start a fully functioning Camunda environment (either version 7 or version 8).

* Create a new directory named `camunda-demo`

  ```bash
  mkdir camunda-demo
  ```

* Change into this new directory. (All steps below assume you are in this new `camunda-demo` directory)

  ```bash
  cd camunda-demo
  ```
 
 * [Authenticate to the Github container registry](https://docs.github.com/en/packages/working-with-a-github-packages-registry/working-with-the-container-registry#authenticating-to-the-container-registry)
 
  ```bash
  docker login ghcr.io -u username -p PAT
  ```

* Now jump to either [Camunda 8](#Camunda-8) or [Camunda 7](#Camunda-7) sections below.

---

## Camunda 8

* Clone the `Camunda Platform` project into your local `camunda-demo` directory.

  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/camunda/camunda-platform.git
  ```
  
* Clone this project (the `camunda-demo-starter` project) into your local `camunda-demo` directory.
   
  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/camunda-consulting/camunda-demo-starter.git
  ```

* Start a Camunda 8 environment from your `camunda-demo` directory

  ```bash
  cd camunda-demo
  ```

  ```bash
  docker-compose -f ./camunda-demo-starter/docker-compose.postgres.yml \
                -f ./camunda-demo-starter/docker-compose.data-api.yml \
                -f ./camunda-demo-starter/docker-compose.reactjs.yml \
                -f ./camunda-demo-starter/docker-compose.smtp.yml \
                -f ./camunda-platform/docker-compose-core.yaml \
                -f ./camunda-demo-starter/docker-compose.c8.yml \
                up -d
  ```

#### After the environment starts up, access each of the components like so:
- camunda-react: http://localhost:3000
- operate: http://localhost:8081
    - username/password: demo/demo
- tasklist: http://localhost:8082
- TODO: optimize isn't currently included .. should we include it as part of default? optimize: http://localhost:808?
- c8-client: http://localhost:9012 
- data-api: http://localhost:9000 
- camunda-postgres: localhost:5432 
  - username/password: camunda/camunda
- zeebe: localhost: 26500

## Components

### camunda-demo-starter

TODO: link to github and short description

This camunda-demo-starter project contains reusable code for mimicking business data services, integration services, and front end UIâ€™s. This reduces the time it takes to build demos. It also provides examples of proven, consistent, reusable system design patterns.
