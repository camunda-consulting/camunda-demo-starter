# Camunda Data API

Nearly every Camunda Environment interacts with custom Business Data Objects such as Employees, Contacts, Appointments, Cases, Documents, etc.

The goal of this project is to provide an easy, consistent framework for creating CRUD rest api's for interacting with these types of custom data objects.

It also provides a convenient rest api for starting instances.

### Quick Start

See the https://github.com/upgradingdave/camunda-demo-starter[`camunda-demo-starter`] project to quickly start a fully functional Camunda 7 or 8 demo environment that includes this project.

### How to contribute

To contribute please fork the project and then make your changes in a branch and create a pull request. The maintainer will merge your changes into the project. Please be sure to remove any customer information from the code or artifacts. See the next sections for more details on setting up your development environment.

### Development

This project is a Spring Boot Java Application.

The Spring Data Rest library is used to provide HATEOAS style api endpoints for creating, reading, updating and deleting custom data objects.

Clone this project (the `camunda-data-api` project) to your local machine

 git clone https://github.com/upgradingdave/camunda-data-api

Build the project using maven

 mvn clean install

Start the project in "dev" mode

 mvn clean spring-boot:run -Dspring-boot.run.profiles=dev

### Docker Compose

When demoing or distributing it makes sense to build this project with docker-compose. When you follow the "Quick Start" steps in the camunda-demo-starter project, the docker image is already built and deployed as a GitHub Package. But, if you are customizing this project, you can also run the docker-compose command like so:

```
 docker-compose -f docker-compose.data-api.yml up -d --build data-api
```

### Developing with NodeJs

Even though everything can be built using `mvn`, it's often convenient to use `npm` and `webpack` to run the ReactJs webapp so that it's possible to update react javascript files and then refresh the browser to see the changes in real time.

NOTE: The following steps have been tested against node v13.14 on mac osx. Use https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm[`nvm`] to quickly install node version 13.14

* Run the following to ensure your npm dependencies are up-to-date

 cd camunda-react
 npm install

* Start a node server process

 npm run live

* Start another terminal and start a `webpack` process

 npm run watch

* Confirm the `node` and `webpack` processes are up and running.

** Browse to http://localhost:3000/app.html and ensure that the form is displayed.
** Make a change to `/src/main/js/reactjs/app.jsx`. Wait for webpack to build the new `bundle.js`, then refresh the browser and make sure you see your changes.

#### More Details about Javascript Environment

* The Javascript/JSX files of interest are in the `src/main/js` folder.
* The files in `src/main/js/reactjs/application/components` are reusable components.
* The files in `src/main/js/reactjs/application/usecase` are use case specific components
* The file `src/main/js/reactjs/application/app.jsx` is the entry point to the application.
